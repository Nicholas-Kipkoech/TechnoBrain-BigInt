## Question 1

Create a class library named Exercise01 that defines extension methods that extend number types such as BigInteger and int with a method named ToWords that returns a string describing the number; for example 18,000,000 would be eighteen million, and 18,456,002,032,011,000,007 would be eighteen quintillion, four hundred and fifty six quadrillion, two trillion, thirty two billion, eleven million, and seven

Create a console application named Exercise02 that uses the class library in Exercise02 to take numeric input from the user and output the string describing the number.
